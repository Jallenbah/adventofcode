# How this inputs directory works
Everything in this directory except this readme file is excluded by the gitignore file.

This is because [you are not supposed to share your inputs](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying)

The directory structure here should be set up like `./year/daynumber.txt` e.g. `./2015/1.txt`, where `1.txt` contains your puzzle input for puzzle `1` of the `2015` event.
